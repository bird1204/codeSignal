# Each cell in a 2D grid contains either a wall ('W') or an enemy ('E'), or is empty ('0'). Bombs can destroy enemies, but walls are too strong to be destroyed. A bomb placed in an empty cell destroys all enemies in the same row and column, but the destruction stops once it hits a wall.

# Return the maximum number of enemies you can destroy using one bomb.

# Note that your solution should have O(field.length Â· field[0].length) complexity because this is what you will be asked during an interview.
